PUBLIC NOTICES
I, R.P. Pragati residing at No.14, Thiyagarajapuram second street, Rangapuram, Vellore-9 by way of this public notice,
I inform that I was given on adoption to my aunt A. Manimegalai w/o. Mr. R. Prabhakaran on 21-1-1998. This adoption deed
was registered on 29-4-1998 at Sub-Registrar office Avadi, Chennai.
After adoption my Christian name T. Maria Christi was changed as R.P. Pragati, but it was not published in the
Government Gazette. Due to my family circumstances I was brought back by my parental mother Dr. A. Anbu
w/o. Mr. A. Thomas (late) in the year 2007. Since then I am with my parental mother. The adoption deed was cancelled
on 30-12-2014 in the Sub-Registrar office Avadi, Chennai.
Now I would like to change my Hindu name R.P. Pragati back to my Christian name T. Maria Christ. Here after I will
be known as T. MARIA CHRISTI.
Vellore,

R. P. PRAGATI.
